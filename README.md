Best Practice Auditd Configuration

## Idea

The idea of this auditd configuration is to provide a basic configuration that

- works out-of-the-box on all major Linux distributions 
- fits most use cases
- produces a reasonable amount of log data
- covers security relevant activity
- is easy to read (different sections, many comments)

## Related Projects

This ruleset is intended to stay agnostic of the downstream detection logic.
It focuses on collecting broadly useful audit telemetry that can then be
analyzed in different ways, for example with Sigma-based tooling or SIEM
queries.

One open source project that can make use of this audit data is
[Aurora Linux](https://github.com/Nextron-Labs/aurora-linux), a lightweight
and customizable Sigma-based agent for Linux that combines eBPF-based telemetry
with user-space enrichment and Sigma rule matching.

## Validation

This ruleset intentionally includes `-i` so that optional distro-specific paths
do not abort loading on systems where some binaries or directories are absent.
This keeps the default deployment simple, but it also means rule load errors are
ignored.

If you want a strict pre-deployment validation, test a temporary copy with the
`-i` line removed, for example:

```bash
grep -v '^-i$' audit.rules > /tmp/audit.rules.strict
auditctl -R /tmp/audit.rules.strict
```

## UID_MIN

Several rules in `audit.rules` use `auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset` to focus on
interactive user activity and exclude unset login sessions.

`1000` is the common `UID_MIN` on many Linux distributions, but it is not
universal. If your host uses a different `UID_MIN`, check `/etc/login.defs`
and replace `1000` in `audit.rules` before deployment:

```bash
awk '$1=="UID_MIN" { print $2 }' /etc/login.defs
```

## AF_ALG / Copy Fail Telemetry

On April 29, 2026, Xint published Copy Fail (CVE-2026-31431), a local
privilege-escalation technique that abuses the kernel crypto userspace
interface (`AF_ALG`) together with `splice()` to corrupt page-cache-backed
files in memory.

This ruleset includes a small `af_alg` block to collect the stable, low-noise
parts of that setup from attributable user sessions:

- `socket(AF_ALG, ...)`
- `bind()` using the common fixed-size `struct sockaddr_alg`
- `setsockopt(..., SOL_ALG, ...)`

This is intentionally more generic than a one-off signature for
`authencesn(hmac(sha256),cbc(aes))` because audit syscall filters cannot match
string arguments. In practice, the algorithm name lives in the `SOCKADDR`
record emitted by `bind()`, so the recommended downstream detection is:

- filter on `key=af_alg`
- inspect `SOCKADDR.saddr` / `SADDR={ saddr_fam=alg ... }`
- flag `salg_type=aead` with `salg_name` containing `authencesn(`
- raise severity when the same `pid`, `exe`, or `auid` emits many such binds in
  a short window

The proof-of-concept described by Xint also relies on repeated `splice()`
operations. Those syscalls are too noisy for the default ruleset on many
systems, so the repository ships only a commented-out `splice_user` overlay in
`audit.rules`. Enable it only if `splice` / `vmsplice` are uncommon in your
environment and correlate it with recent `af_alg` activity from the same
process or user session.

## Video Explanations by IppSec

IppSec captured a video that explains how to detect the exploitation of the OMIGOD vulnerability using auditd. In that video, he walks you through the audit configuration maintained in this repo and explains how to use it. I highly recommend this video to get a better understanding of what is happening in the config.
